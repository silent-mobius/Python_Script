# Python Script Flow Control

## Python Conditions and If statements

Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

*  Equals: a == b
*  Not Equals: a != b
*  Less than: a < b
*  Less than or equal to: a <= b
*  Greater than: a > b
*  Greater than or equal to: a >= b

These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

An "if statement" is written by using the `if` keyword.

##### Example
```py
a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
```
## Indentation
> Python relies on indentation (whitespace at the beginning of a line) to define scope in the code. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose. 
## if .. else if
