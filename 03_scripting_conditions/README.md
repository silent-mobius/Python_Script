## Python Conditions and If statements

Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

*  Equals: a == b
*  Not Equals: a != b
*  Less than: a < b
*  Less than or equal to: a <= b
*  Greater than: a > b
*  Greater than or equal to: a >= b

These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.
An "if statement" is written by using the `if` keyword.  The condition the `if` keyword is checking, is called `expression`.Expression specifies the conditions which are based on Boolean expression. When a Boolean expression is evaluated it produces either a value of true or false. If the expression evaluates true the same amount of indented statement(s) following if will be executed. This group of the statement(s) is called a block. 


## Indentation
> Python relies on indentation (whitespace at the beginning of a line) to define scope in the code. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
