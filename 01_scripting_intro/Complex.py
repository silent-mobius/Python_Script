 Mathematically, a complex number (generally used in engineering) is a number of the form A+Bi 
 where i is the imaginary number. Complex numbers have a real and imaginary part. 
 Python supports complex numbers either by specifying the number in (real + imagJ) or 
 (real + imagj) form or using a built-in method complex(x, y). See the following statements 
 in Python Shell.
