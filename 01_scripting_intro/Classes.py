The basic idea behind an object-oriented programming (OOP) is to combine both data
and associated procedures (known as methods) into a single unit which operate on the data.
Such a unit is called an object.
Python is an object-oriented language, everything in Python is an object.We have already
worked with some objects in Python, (See Python data type chapter) for example strings,
lists are objects defined by the string and list classes which are available by
default into Python. Let's declare two objects a string and a list and test their type
with type() function.
